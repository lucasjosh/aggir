Simple feed aggregator + search, focusing on developer / academic blogs.

You will need a Redis server running locally for storage.

Usage:

rake feeds:create Creating the default feeds
rake feeds:update Updating the feeds
rake feeds:latest Display last 15 headlines
rake feeds:add url=URL Add url to the feeds
rake feeds:update_search Send all entries to Solr, running on localhost:8080

rake pdf:latest Display latest PDF links
rake pdf:download Download the PDFs into the downloads/ directory

ruby aggir_server.rb (if you want to start a simple local instance of Sinatra)
  http://localhost:4567



Requirements :
rfeedparser ( http://github.com/jmhodges/rfeedparser/tree/master ) (Needs to be built)
Redis ( http://code.google.com/p/redis/ )

For A Simple Web UI:
sinatra
haml

For Testing:
Shoulda ( http://thoughtbot.com/projects/shoulda )
FlexMock

For Solr:
Solr ( http://lucene.apache.org/solr/ )
Tomcat (http://tomcat.apache.org)

You will need to grab Tomcat / Solr.  Put the solr_config/aggir.xml into $TOMCAT_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/.  You'll need to update the solr_config/aggir.xml to point to the correct paths.  Soon, you'll be able to just set variables for this.
