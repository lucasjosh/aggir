			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I worked for <a href="http://www.earthlink.net">EarthLink</a> three different times so it always holds a special place in my heart.  It is tough to read <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10157670-93.html?part=rss&#038;subj=news&#038;tag=2547-1_3-0-20">things like this</a> though.  With all the cuts they&#8217;ve done, they were profitable in 2008 but really what does the future hold?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve talked to the few people still there and it really is just a skeleton operation technically and eventually that will need to be cut.  It really is too bad since there was always so much promise but really not as much execution.</p>
<blockquote><p>
All of this leaves EarthLink without a clear growth strategy. Once dial-up dies off, the company has no wireless or fixed infrastructure of its own to offer competing services. And even though cost-cutting has helped the company return to profitability, it won&#8217;t help solve the company&#8217;s fundamental problem, which is a lack of future strategy.
</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If asked for a list of books which give a basic overview of the things I do as a coder, I usually suggest <i>Microserfs</i>, <i>Hackers and Painters</i> and maybe something like The Cathedral and the Bazaar.  Now though, I think I&#8217;ll add <a href="http://thenumerati.net/index.cfm?catID=18"><i>The Numerati</i></a> to that list.  It isn&#8217;t that my work makes me one of the Numerati but it does give a view of how the world is changing and what sorts of things computer systems will be handing in the future.</p>
<p>I enjoyed this book quite a bit.  My only quibble was the lack of real <i>meat</i> in the discussion about the math and the systems but it&#8217;s understandable since this was a book for the mainstream not geeks like me.</p>
<p>The ability to take large amounts of data and analyze it would seem to be something only companies would be able to do but I think individuals can do their own now.  You could use the combination of EC2, <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org">Hadoop</a> and <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/mahout/">Mahout</a> and become a Numerati yourself.</p>

<p>This is pretty weird for me because I played football with Jay when he was a senior and I was a junior.  There was always little bits of chatter about his strength and workout routine and some speculated he was getting <i>help</i>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a crazy, connected world sometimes.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seth Godin <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/01/time-to-start-a.html">writes about he would start a newspaper</a> with roughly six people or so.  What about the institutions that have many more people already writing for publication?  </p>
<p>When I was at <a href="http://www.latimes.com">The Times</a>, a few of us had this idea, trying to capitalize on everyone&#8217;s belief that focusing on local news is the way for a newspaper to survive.  Since everyone lives in a neighborhood, why not use that for the beats?  Make sure everyone has a laptop which can handle the reporting as well as any video / photo editing that needs to happen as well as a camera which can also do video.</p>
<p>Editors should lay down the law that anyone seen in the office more than once a week would be in serious trouble.  Instead, they should be talking to local businesses about what&#8217;s going on, interviewing local high school athletes and becoming a known entity at all city meetings.  This would allow for local stories to be reported on in a much different way.  Blogs could be started for cities that would become must-reads for everyone involved.  A few times a week, have blog entries reverse-published into the print edition but overall make everything focused on the Web.</p>
<p>Would this work?  Would this save a newspaper?  Who knows but really at this point, what do they have to lose?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tomorrow I start employment at <a href="http://www.yellowpages.com">YellowPages.com / AT&#038;T Interactive</a>.  Though I&#8217;m very excited and can&#8217;t wait to get started, there is still plenty of sadness and disappointment about leaving <a href="http://www.latimes.com">The Times</a>.</p>
<p>If someone were to ask me exactly why I was leaving, I couldn&#8217;t do much better than pointing them to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001198.html">this post by Jeff Atwood</a> and drilling down to this quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Also, having programmers who believe that their employers actually give a damn about them is probably a good business strategy for companies that actually want to be around five or ten years from now.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I could go on and on, citing specific examples but really what would be the point?  I&#8217;d burn bridges and embarrass the people I know and respect who are still there.  That&#8217;s really not my style.</p>
<p>Instead I&#8217;ll just say I had an amazing time while working for <a href="http://www.latimes.com">The Times</a> and I&#8217;m very proud of the work we did for <a href="http://topics.latimes.com">Topics</a> and the <a href="http://articles.latimes.com">Archives</a>.  Those will hopefully stay around and benefit the world at large.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s all in the past now.  Tomorrow is a new day, filled with new challenges.</p>
